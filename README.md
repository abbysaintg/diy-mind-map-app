# MIND MAPPER

Mind Mapper is a web application that allows you to create mind maps to brainstorm ideas. You can create idea nodes, connect them, and customize each node.

This is a Ruby on Rails and React app that uses a PostgreSQL database to store data.

This app was created for my capstone project at Flatiron's Software Engineering Bootcamp.

You can try it out here: https://diy-mind-mapper.onrender.com

3. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
4. Create the database: `rails db:create`
5. Migrate the database: `rails db:migrate`
